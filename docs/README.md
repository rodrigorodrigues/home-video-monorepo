## Diagram Sources

Draw.io source files migrated from legacy docs:

- `draw.io/Design.drawio`
- `draw.io/Untitled Diagram.drawio`

## Migration Notes

This project was previously split into separate repositories (`web`, `api`, and `docs`).

Migration policy:

- monorepo docs are source of truth for current setup
- old polyrepo references are treated as legacy
- when conflict exists, keep monorepo behavior

Legacy repo:

- [home-video-docs](https://github.com/eliasjunior/home-video-docs)
